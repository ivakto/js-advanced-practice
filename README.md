# JavaScript Advanced Practice: DOM, OOP, and Advanced Functionality

## Project Overview

This repository showcases my solutions and practice exercises for advanced JavaScript concepts (ES6+), focusing on complex language features, browser interaction, and object-oriented paradigms. These exercises serve as proof of proficiency in developing interactive, data-driven applications.

The structure is intentionally organized by technical module to facilitate targeted review and quick verification of advanced skill sets.

## Key Technical Domains

The solutions within this repository validate competence in critical advanced JavaScript areas:

| Technical Area | Specific Concepts Addressed |
| :--- | :--- |
| **DOM Manipulation** | Working with the Document Object Model (DOM), event handling, dynamic content generation, and efficient DOM composition. |
| **Objects and Composition** | Prototypes, Inheritance, Object Composition, Factory Functions, and advanced Object methods. |
| **Classes and OOP** | ES6 Class Syntax, Constructors, Encapsulation, and the principles of Object-Oriented Programming. |
| **Advanced Functions** | Closures, Context (`this`), Function Binding, and Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE). |
| **Asynchronous Programming** | Promises (and Async/Await, if included in the practice) for handling time-dependent operations. |
| **Unit Testing (if applicable)** | Implementation of basic Unit Tests to ensure code reliability and correctness. |

## Repository Structure and Organization

The code is logically segmented into directories corresponding to major learning modules:

* `/syntax-functions-and-statements/`
* `/arrays-and-nested-arrays/`
* `/objects-and-composition/`
* `/dom-introduction/`
* `/dom-events/`
* `/advanced-functions/`
* `/classes-and-encapsulation/`

## Local Setup and Execution

All exercises are built on a standard JavaScript environment. **Node.js** is required for executing solutions that do not require a browser environment (e.g., pure logic exercises).
