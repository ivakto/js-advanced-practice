//  An array can be sorted by passing a comparing function to the Array.sort() function.
//Â· Creating a comparing function by 2 criteria can be achieved by first comparing by the main criteria, 
// if the 2 items are different (the result of the compare is not 0) - return the result as the result of the comparing function. 
// If the two items are the same by the main criteria (the result of the comparison is 0), we need to compare by the second criteria 
// and the result of that comparison is the result of the comparing function.
